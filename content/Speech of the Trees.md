As one can imagine, trees have quite a different mechanism for producing sound and therefore language than the other humanoid races in the world. This makes it impossible for humanoids to accurately speak the language but an attempt is made here to transliterate some of the sounds to make a reasonable approximation of the language.

## Mechanisms for producing sound

Trees obviously don't have a respiratory tract to use to produce sound like most of the humanoid races do. Instead they rely on various creaking and cracking noises produced by their branches and leaves. This also means that, unlike the humanoid races, multiple sounds can, and often are, produced simultaneously. Here however, only the dominant sound will be transliterated.
