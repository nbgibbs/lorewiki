[[Rusty]]

An actor of sorts. Propaganda. 

[[Richard Phillips]]

Iona joined the warforged uprising during her time working under [[Richard Phillips]].
Once the uprising evolved into a mass-exodus of warforged, she joined the group that wanted to build their own city. She contributed what she could to the beginnings of [[Mechastra]], though refused to have political influence. Soon after the city was founded, she joined a business for warforged to get modifications, lovingly named [[Solder's Shack]]. In her work there, she found she loved the process of turning an idea of a new project into reality. Using the materials she could afford, she modified herself until she was nearly unrecognizable from the actor for Mr. Phillips's plays. Although her project on her self-modifications was ongoing, Iona had the impression that something was missing. She visited a local scrapyard, and created multiple prototypes for a companion. Through sheer will and a pound or two of stubbornness, she managed to create [[Rusty]]. By then, his consciousness had gone through multiple stages and had finally fit well with the physical casing she made for him.
They worked together for a few years in Solder's Shack, which had since grown in popularity with warforged and cybernetically enhanced humanoids alike. A few warforged customers introduced Iona to [[aether]], one of which bragged about the discount they received theirs at. In private, after some convincing, Iona was able to collect the name of Dr. V. After some digging and conversing with locals and customers, she was able to purchase aether for herself and Rusty. Applying a chemical over the substance allowed it to glow yellow, rather than its usual blue. A few months afterwards, she recieved a message from [[Dr. V]] asking her to visit and help him with securing an escaped [[2b|robot]]. This is where the campaign begins.

After the battle with [[2b]], Iona searches through his head's hard drive to recover the most recent 5 and most distant 10 videos from the file. Every member of the campaign, save for [[Shal√≥k]], is featured before meeting with [[Dr. V]] in the 10th video. Iona wants to learn more about 2b's side of the story. However, the files started to corrupt her with more of it's influence than was intended, so she plans to find a software expert able to learn more about 2b (and a possible source of the [[2b#10th Video|10th video]]).
