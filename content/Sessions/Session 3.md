Because we learned that [[Dr. V]] had at least in part lied to us about how [[2b]] escaped we weren't sure we could trust him. So we tried to gain some more intel by interviewing some employees at his factory and by attempting to search some offices. Nothing much was learned and our attempts to be subtle came to an end when [[Oyster]] stumbled on a crystalline plant outside [[Dr. V]]'s lab.

[[Dr. V]] asked how it went and when we mentioned the red [[Aether]] he became agitated and told us it is called [[Mysterium]] and can cause devices to become erratic and explode. 

He also gave us pagers and permission to take a book we could give to [[some dude I can't remember his name]]. 

When we arrived at the [[fancy govermenty building]] and stepped into [[some dude I can't remember his name]]'s office [[Ember Voss]] was also there waiting for us demanding to know what we were up to. Voss also had a shard of [[Mysterium]]

Things went south and [[Isra]] paged [[Dr. V]] who came to rescue us and take the [[Mysterium]] from Voss. That went south too and [[Dr. V]] went down but before Voss could escape [[Rowan]] threw a dagger and broke the shard causing an explosion almost killing all of us again.
