Oyster is a free-spirited explorer, spending their life hopping trains and seeing the world. They grew up in [[Iron Spire]] and explored the city with their sister, [[Dove]], which sparked their love of wandering. They see little value in most material possessions, and don't like spending money on anything not necessary for survival. They get everything they can from dumpsters and make their own clothes (or alter clothes that they find).
