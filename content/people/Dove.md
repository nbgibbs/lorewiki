sister of [[Oyster]]

Dove is an energetic artist who creates sculptures from cast-aside bits and pieces, as well as drawings and poetry that she doesn't show to others.  She enjoys organizing group events and planning things, and her friend group depends on her maybe more than they should to plan stuff for them. She's very creative and sees the world through that lens, always searching for inspiration. She's a very sentimental person and attaches great meaning to otherwise worthless objects, to the point where she has quite a bit of space in her room set aside for trinkets that she's emotionally attached to.

Has one of the [[shiny beetles]]
