Dr. V is most well known for being the creator of [[Aether]] and a businessman running a factory where the Ather is produced. He is an elderly man with multiple robotic arms in addition to his normal ones. 

At some point in the resent past he created [[2b]], a mechanical servant of sorts. After 2b escaped the party was recruited to retrieve him.

## Morals
Dr. V is generally considered to be a kind old man that treats his workers well and even gave [[Iona]] her [[Aether]] at a large discount. However it was discovered that he lied about how [[2b]] escaped. He told the party that a worker accidentally left the door unlocked, but examination of 2b's memories showed that Dr. V became dissatisfied with the results of a personality test and attempted to dismantle 2b at which point he pushed Dr. V and escaped.
